Hi! I'm Alper, an incoming freshman to UC Berkeley and aspiring biomedical/EECS major. Besides biomed, I have a strong interest in robotics, AI, Augmented Reality/XR technologies, and spreading STEM opportunities to all! For the last 4 years, I have been fortunate to gain significant research experience from my research internship with Dr.Ben Amor's Interactive Robotics Lab at ASU working on projects ranging from optimization of prosthetic movements to open source augmented reality systems.
